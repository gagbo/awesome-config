#+TITLE: Awesome configuration

Now that I know Lua better, I might make this work to my liking.

* Dependencies
** Autostart / daemons
- Picom
- xfce4-power-manager
- nextcloud

** Widgets
- iw
- luarocks install lua-socket
- [[./json.lua][json.lua]] for the weather widget

* Secrets
The [[./secrets-example.lua][secrets-example]] file shows which secrets are currently used and should be
correctly defined.

* TODO Tasks [5/12]
** DONE Add a "test" target to Makefile
This should run awesome in Xephyr for the test phase
** TODO Reduce icons dependencies [0/2]
*** TODO Brightness Widget
*** TODO Weather widget
** TODO Add an example secrets file (or use defensive programming)
** TODO Check that all dependencies in README are listed correctly
** TODO Make the background not a hard path
Use feh or nitrogen if possible
** CANCELLED Make the configuration a luarock (vendor everything like stack for XMonad) :CANCELLED:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2020-05-26 mar. 15:50] \\
  Fixing awesome version cannot be done with luarocks, so the main reason for this whole thing is gone.
:END:
*** DONE Add a basic rocks spec
*** CANCELLED Add fixed depedencies in the spec :CANCELLED:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2020-05-26 mar. 15:49] \\
  Awesome is essentially a C program so luarocks can't help, and lain is not easily fetchable from luarocks
:END:
Use luarocks spec to :
- Fix awesome version
- Fix lain version

The rest has to stay as git submodules.

*** DONE Test installation of luarocks spec
Make sure the Luarocks spec correctly install the awesome binary
This will prevent the last part of stability I need.
** TODO Find a way to vendor/lock/bundle awesome version and test against that
